# Introduction to machine learning.

__Client__ - mobile operator.

__Input Data__ - data on the behavior of customers who have already switched to these mobile phone plans.

__Target__ - build a model for the classification problem, which will choose the appropriate plan.

__What's Done__:

data splitting to features and target;

data splitting to train, valid and test samples;

3 machine learning models fitted and compared (with self-made hyperparameters variation):

- decision tree
- random forest
- logistic regression;

best model tested on test sample and tested for adequacy;

accuracy on test sample - 0.8

accuracy on dummy model - 0,6.

Tools used - pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib.pyplot

Models used - Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier.
