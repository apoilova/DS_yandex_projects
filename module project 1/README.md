# Computer games market research.

__Client__ - Video Game store.

__Input Data__ - game sales data, user and expert ratings, genres and platforms (e.g. Xbox or PlayStation).

__Target__ - Analyze the factors influencing the game's success.

__What's Done__:

1. Exploratory Data Analysis:

- The platform generation cycle lasts 5-6 years. New generations appear when sales decline.
- Median sales for most platforms are below half a million copies, but some platforms have hits with sales exceeding 5 million copies.
- There's no strong correlation between game ratings and sales, but critic reviews have more influence.

2. Creating Regional Profiles:

-The most profitable genre is Shooter, while Puzzle and Strategy bring in the lowest revenue.
-In Japan, portable platforms are preferred, with three portable devices (Nintendo 3DS, Wii U, PlayStation Vita) in the top rankings. In the US and Europe, PlayStation 4, Wii, and Xbox One dominate.
-Japanese and Western markets differ significantly. The most popular genre in the West is Shooter, while in Japan, it's RPG.
-The best-selling games on the Western market are rated "Mature" (not suitable for individuals under 17). In Japan, games without ratings are prevalent, indicating that ESRB ratings do not influence the Japanese market.

3. Hypotheses tested:

- The average user ratings for Xbox One and PC are different.
- The average user ratings for the Action and Sports genres are different.
